# Mbed Scanning Sensor Platform

This code is written in C and, using the included makefile, compiles to executable code for the ARM mbed microcontroller. This project uses an mbed to drive a distance-detecting sensor platform. The sensor platform uses a PWM controlled servo motor, a ADC controller IR blaster and receiver, and an ultrasound detector. Results from the sensors are plotted on the graph.
